<details>
  <summary><strong>How long is a conference session? Do I really need that much material to cover that time?</strong></summary>
  <p>Conference sessions are available in 45-minute, 60-minute, and 75-minute formats. Regardless of the session length, we encourage you to allocate time for Q&amp;A to engage with your audience—typically 5–10 minutes for a 45-minute session and 10–15 minutes for longer sessions.</p>
  <p>Select the session length that best fits your content, focusing on delivering clear and impactful information while leaving room for discussion and audience interaction.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>How are workshops structured, and how much time will I have to present?</strong></summary>
  <p>A full-day workshop is 300 minutes, divided into 75-minute segments with breaks or a lunch break in between. A half-day workshop is 150 minutes, split into two 75-minute segments with a break in between.</p>
  <p>Depending on your workshop format, you can include in-depth demonstrations, hands-on instruction, and time for Q&amp;A to create an engaging and interactive experience.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>What is the difference between a workshop and a conference session?</strong></summary>
  <p>Workshops are longer, in-depth learning opportunities designed for hands-on instruction, detailed demonstrations, and interactive engagement. A full-day workshop spans 300 minutes, while a half-day workshop is 150 minutes, both divided into 75-minute segments with breaks in between.</p>
  <p>In contrast, conference sessions are shorter presentations lasting 45, 60, or 75 minutes. These sessions focus on delivering concise, impactful content, typically with some time reserved for Q&amp;A.</p>
  <p>Workshops are ideal for diving deep into a topic, while conference sessions are great for sharing insights, best practices, or high-level overviews.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>When will I know if my presentation proposal has been accepted?</strong></summary>
  <p>You will be notified via email by mid-April if your proposal has been accepted. Once notified, you will have 5 business days to confirm your participation. Please ensure your speaker profile includes accurate and up-to-date contact information to avoid any delays.</p>
</details>

<details>
