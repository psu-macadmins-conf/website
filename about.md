MacAdmins is the premier East Coast annual conference for anyone who deploys and manages Macs and iOS devices. The conference was established in 2009 as a one-day event for Penn State employees. As interest grew from outside companies and institutions, the conference was opened to the public. Over the last several years it has attracted over 550 IT professionals yearly from around the world.

Over the last several years, each conference has featured 60 sessions and five workshops with top-notch speakers in the Mac Admins community. The full-day workshops cover in-depth topics like security, device deployment, and career development. The sixty sessions include topics data management, system configuration, programming, and vendor specific software.

We bring together over 500 professionals to learn, connect, and grow.
