<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>What demographics can you share from your previous conferences?</strong></p>
<p>Last year's conference drew a diverse audience of IT professionals, with nearly half identifying as System Engineers or Administrators (48%) and a strong presence in User Support (31%), Endpoint Management (24%), and IT Management (22%). Attendees ranged from first-time participants (41%) to long-time supporters, with the rest having attended multiple conferences. This mix highlights the conference's appeal to both new audiences and a loyal, engaged community, offering sponsors valuable exposure to key decision-makers and hands-on IT practitioners.</p>
