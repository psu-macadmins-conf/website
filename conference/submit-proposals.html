<p><strong><b>NEW THIS YEAR: </b></strong>In response to feedback, we are trialing a small number of sessions to fit into shorter time slots (60 and 45 minute presentation sessions) Please note that we cannot offer a waived conference registration fee for more than one presenter for 45 minute sessions.</p>
<p>Reminder: This is a community event — so product and/or vendor sales pitches are limited to sponsored sessions. <a href="https://macadmins.psu.edu/conference/sponsorships/">Learn how more about sponsorships on our website.</a></p>
<h2>Co-presenters</h2>
<p>While typical conference sessions feature one to two presenters, workshops can accommodate up to three presenters. Due to time constraints, only one presenter is allowed for 45-minute sessions. However, for longer sessions of 60 and 75 minutes, there is more flexibility to include multiple speakers.</p>
<p>Co-presenting at the MacAdmins Conference is an excellent way to collaborate and bring diverse perspectives to your session. This format offers a great opportunity to share the workload, increase audience engagement, and create a well-rounded presentation. Each co-presenter can contribute their unique expertise, making the session more dynamic and enriching for attendees.</p>
<h2>Notifications</h2>
<p>Submissions will be accepted and reviewed on a rotating basis. Speakers will have 5 business days to respond to notices of acceptance. (Even a "Thanks, I need to talk to someone to approve my travel" is a response). Failure to respond within 5 days will result in a revocation of the invitation to speak.</p>
<h2>Presenter Package</h2>
<p>Accepted speakers receive complimentary registration for the conference, which includes access to workshops, sessions, provided meals, and conference events. Presenters are responsible for arranging and payment of their travel to/from the conference and their lodging</p>
