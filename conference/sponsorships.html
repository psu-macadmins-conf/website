<p>Interested in sponsoring the MacAdmins Conference? Want to get your product in the hands of influential Mac administrators from across the world?</p>
<p>The annual MacAdmins Conference from has been one of the most anticipated events for the community over the past ten years! An average of 600 people attend from all across the world, coming from as far as the UK, France, New Zealand and Switzerland in addition to Canada and the United States. Outside of Apple‚Äôs own developer conference, MacAdmins is now one of the largest Apple-related tech conferences in the world.</p>
<p>The MacAdmins Conference draws attendees from a diverse group of industries. We continue to attract people from various higher education institutions outside of Penn State including Carnegie Mellon, Florida State, and School of Visual Arts. We also saw a strong presence from many major corporations including SAP, Facebook, Target, Disney, and JPMorgan Chase. While Apple continues to be a leader in the education industry, we believe the increased adoption of Apple ecosystems in the enterprise and small business contributes to our conference‚Äôs popularity.</p>
<p><strong>The MacAdmins Conference is the ideal venue to promote your product to a relevant audience.</strong></p>
<p>Our sponsors agree:</p>
<p><em>"Conference was highly organized, great attendees, massive opportunity."</em></p>
<p><em>"Venue was great. Rooms were great."</em></p>
<p><em>"The attendees you had at the event were very good."</em></p>
<p><em>"My Systems Engineer would have liked to attend many (sessions) as well. Your technical presentations seemed extremely interesting."</em></p>
