<p>The MacAdmins Conference welcomes presentations across a wide range of topics related to Apple ecosystem management. We’re looking for technical sessions covering macOS deployment, iOS device management, and automation, as well as power skills like team management, leadership, and fostering collaboration. Sessions on security, scripting, and managing third-party software are also highly valued. This conference is a vibrant platform for sharing knowledge, best practices, and real-world experiences in all aspects of Apple IT administration. Whether you’re addressing emerging challenges or proven strategies, we encourage you to contribute to the dynamic exchange of ideas that shapes the future of the Apple IT community.</p>
<p>In a recent survey, the MacAdmins Community made excellent topic suggestions.  Here is a sampling of their ideas:</p>
