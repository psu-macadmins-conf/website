<p><strong>Evening Events Information</strong><br />
We have three great evening events planned for conference attendees. All feature dinner and a great opportunity to network with colleagues, speakers, sponsors, and conference staff.</p>
<p><a name="Day1"></a><strong>Tuesday, {{ day1.date }}  - 5-8 p.m.: Conference Opening and Dinner</strong></p>
<p>We are currently working on the details for this event and will announce them soon.</p>
<p><a name="Day2"></a><strong>Wednesday, {{ day2.date }}  - 5-9 p.m.: Admins in the Outfield (Off-site event)</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“We Are” taking the MacAdmins Conference to the ballgame. Join us at Medlar’s Field for a “ballpark” themed all-you-can-eat picnic dinner and a night to remember. Play the field and network with fellow MacAdmins while watching the State College Spikes take on the West Virginia Black Bears. We’ll have our own private picnic area, and each attendee will be provided a ticket for a seat in the stands to enjoy the game. If so inspired, partake in half off draft beers at all cash bars throughout the ballpark. As always, this is a family friendly event. “Ike’s Kid Zone” will be open and free for all of our “mini” MacAdmins. Bussing between the Penn Stater, The Penn State Berkey Creamery, Downtown State College, and Medlar’s Field will be provided.</p>
