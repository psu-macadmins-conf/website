<p>MacAdmins is the premier East Coast annual conference for anyone who deploys and manages Macs and iOS devices. The conference was established in 2009 as a one-day event for Penn State employees.

Over the last several years it has attracted over 550 IT professionals yearly from around the world.</p>
<p>Over the last several years, each conference has featured 60 sessions and five workshops with top-notch speakers in the Mac Admins community.
