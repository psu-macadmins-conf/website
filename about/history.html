<p>The Penn State MacAdmins Conference has grown at a rapid rate year after year. Every year we learn more and more, and it's still fun—even with all the work that goes into it. It's a very rewarding experience, especially during the conference week when it all comes together.</p>

<h1>2010 – Our First Conference!</h1>
<p>The first MacAdmins Conference was held in 2010 and was a two-day event. The idea to host an annual conference occurred when three Mac IT folks were returning home from the 2010 MacWorld Conference and waiting for their next flight. That was in January. Who knew that they and their other Penn State Mac IT friends would be able to pull it off and have the conference ready by May 11?</p>
<p>The conference had presenters from Apple, Inc. as well as Mac system admins from Penn State. The conference was free for all attendees and open to anyone within or outside of Penn State University. There were two main tracks: Mac Deployment and Penn State Directory Integration. Attendance was limited to 100 people. Including the conference staff and speakers, there were a total of 120 people.</p>
<p>The slides from the 2010 conference are available on our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/resources-archive/" title="Resources Archive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Resources</a> archive page.</p>

<h1>2011 – Hey, Let’s Try This Again!</h1>
<p>We held our second conference May 10–12, 2011, again in the Business Building. Attendance was limited to 150. We charged $100 per attendee registration.</p>
<p>The conference had 21 technical sessions for system admins and IT support of Macs and iOS devices. The sessions were presented by experts in macOS and iOS deployments from Apple, Penn State University, Pennsylvania College of Technology, Liberty University, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, IT consultants, and K–12 institutions.</p>
<p>The three-day conference was held at the Penn State University Park campus in the Business Building. There were over 50 people on the waiting list after registration was closed.</p>
<p>The conference sold out quickly—in only 19 days! Of the 150 total attendees, 30% (45 people) were from Penn State. We were surprised and happy to see that the other 70% were from outside of Penn State, representing both education and industry. In fact, 49% of attendees traveled from outside Pennsylvania, from over 20 different states—including as far as California.</p>
<p>To help keep costs low, we didn’t pay for any advertising. We announced the conference on various macOS public lists, including the MacEnterprise.org list, which is hosted here at Penn State.</p>
<p>The conference was a huge hit and very well received. During the closing feedback session, attendees unanimously agreed they would pay more to attend if we moved to a bigger facility and provided more amenities.</p>

<h1>2012 – This Is Becoming a Fun Habit!</h1>
<p>Our third annual conference was held May 2–4, 2012. We had a total of 219 attendees and 43 speakers, and a whopping 43 technical sessions.</p>
<p>This year, we held the conference at the Penn Stater Conference Center. We moved to this new facility because the Business Building was no longer available for our preferred dates, and it limited us to only 150 attendees—even though we still had a long waiting list. We realized we needed to increase capacity and grow the conference.</p>
<p>At first, we weren’t sure we were ready to move to a new location that we weren't fully comfortable with yet. (Were we a “real” conference now?) We also weren’t sure if people would be willing to pay more, which we had to charge just to cover our costs.</p>

<h1>2013 – OK, Let’s Rock This.</h1>
<p>We held our fourth annual conference May 21–24, 2013. We had a total of 332 attendees, 82% of whom were from outside of Penn State. It had become clear after the first two years that the conference was valuable not only to Penn State IT staff, but also to local industry, government, K–12, and other higher education institutions.</p>
<p>This is the year we started to get into our groove. We knew we still had a lot to learn, but we felt confident the conference would be well received—and hopefully sell out. It did! We ended up with over 70 people on the waiting list even after closing registration.</p>
<p>We had nearly 50 technical sessions that year.</p>
