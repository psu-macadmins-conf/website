<p>The Penn State MacAdmins conference has grown at a rapid rate, year after year. Every year we learn more and more, and it's still fun, even with all of the work that goes into it. It's a very rewarding experience, especially during the conference week when it all comes together.</p>
<h1>2010 - Our first conference!</h1>
<p>The first MacAdmins conference was held in 2010 and was a two day event. The idea to host an annual conference occurred when three Mac IT folks were returning home from the 2010 MacWorld conference and waiting for their next flight. That was in January. Who knew that they and their other Penn State Mac IT friends would be able to pull it off and have the conference ready by May 11?</p>
<p>The conference had presenters from Apple, Inc. as well as Mac system admins from Penn State. The conference was free for all attendees, and was open to anyone within or outside of Penn State University. There were two main tracks - Mac Deployment and Penn State Directory Integration. Attendance was limited to 100 people. Including the conference staff and speakers, there were a total of 120 people.</p>
<p>The slides from the 2010 conference are available on our <a title="Resources Archive" href="http://macadmins.psu.edu/resources-archive/" target="_blank">Resources</a> archive page.</p>
<h1>2011 - Hey, let's try this again!</h1>
<p>We held our second conference May 10 - 12, 2011 in the Business Building again. Attendance was limited to 150. We charged $100 per attendee registration.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The conference had 21 technical sessions for system admins and IT support of Macs and iOS devices. The sessions were presented by experts in Mac OS X and iOS deployments from Apple, Penn State University, Pennsylvania College of Technology, Liberty University, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, IT consultants, and K-12 institutions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The 3 day conference was held at the Penn State University Park campus in the Business Building. Registration was limited to 150. There were over 50 people on the waiting list, after registration was closed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The conference sold out quickly, in only 19 days! Of the 150 total attendees, 30% (45) were from Penn State. We were very surprised and happy to see the other 70% were from outside of Penn State, from education and industry. 49% of the attendees traveled from outside of Pennsylvania, comprising over 20 different states, and as far as California.</p>
<p>To help keep costs low, we didn't pay for any advertising. We announced the conference on various Mac OS X public lists, including the MacEnterprise.org list which is hosted here at Penn State.</p>
<p>It turned out that the conference was a huge hit and very well received, and in the closing feedback session attendees unanimously agreed that they would pay more to attend the conference if we were to move to a bigger facility and provide more amenities.</p>
<h1>2012 - This is becoming a fun habit!</h1>
<p>Our third annual conference was held May 2 - 4, 2012. We had a total of 219 attendees and 43 speakers. There were a whopping 43 technical sessions.</p>
<p>This year we held the conference at the Penn Stater Conference Center. We ended up moving the conference to a new facility because the Business Building was no longer available for the dates that we wanted to hold the conference, and was limiting us to only 150 attendees, when we still had a lot of people on the waiting list. We realized that we needed to increase the number of attendees and grown the conference.</p>
<p>At first we weren't sure if we were ready to move the conference to a new location that we were comfortable with yet. (Are we a "real" conference now?) We were also not sure if people would be willing to pay more for the conference, which we had to increase to simply cover our costs.</p>
<h1>2013 - Ok, let's rock this.</h1>
<p>We held our fourth annual conference May 21 - May 24. We had a total of 332 attendees. 82% of the attendees were from outside of Penn State. It was obvious to us after the first two conferences that the conference was able to help not only Penn State IT people but also local industry, government, K-12 and other Higher Ed institutions.</p>
<p>This is the year that we started to get in our groove. We knew that we still had a lot to learn, but we felt confident that the conference would be well received and would hopefully sell out. It did. We ended up having over 70 people on the waiting list, even after we closed registration!</p>
<p>We had nearly 50 technical sessions.</body></html></p>
